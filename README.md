# AML-UA-XSLT
The AML-UA-XSLT contains XSL transformation rules which convert either AutomationML models to OPC UA XML nodeset descriptions or vice versa. The transformation rules are created according to the OPC UA companion specification „AutomationML for OPC UA“. The xslt files can be used in combination with standard XSLT processors which are not part of AML-UA-XSLT.
